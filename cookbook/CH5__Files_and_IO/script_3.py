5.8. Iterating over fixed-sized records

Problem: Instead of iterating over a file by lines, you want to iterate over a
         collection of fixed-sized records or chunks.

# The records object in this example is an iterable that will produce fixed-sized
# chunks until end of the file is reached. However, be aware that the last item may
# have fewer bytes than expected if the file size is not an exact multiple of the
# record size.

# In the solution, the functools.partial is used to create a callable that reads a fixed
# number of bytes from a file each time itâ€™s called. The sentinel of b'' is what gets returned
# when a file is read but the end of file has been reached.

5.9. Reading Binary Data into a Mutable Buffer

Problem: You want to read binary data directly into a mutable buffer without any intermediate
         copying. Perhaps you want to mutate the data in-place and write it back out to a file.

Solution: To read data into a mutable array, use the readinto() method of files

5.10. Memory Mapping Binary Files

Problem: You want to memory map a binary file into a mutable byte array, possibly for
         random access to its contents or to make in-place modifications

Solution: Use the mmap module to memory map files. Here is a utility function that shows
          how to open a file and memory map it in a portable manner.

# TO use this function, you would need to have a file already created and filled with data.
# Here is an example of how you could initially create a file and expand it to a desired size.

m = memory_map('data')
print(len(m))
print(m[0:10])
print(m[0])

# reassign a slice
m[0:11] = b'Hello World'
m.close()

# verify that changes were made
with open("data", 'rb') as f:
    print(f.read(11))

# The mmap object returned by mmap() can also be used as a context manager, in which
# case the underlying file is closed automatically.
