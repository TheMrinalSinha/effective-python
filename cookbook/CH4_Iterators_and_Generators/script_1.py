4.1. Manually Consuming an Iterator

Problem: You need to process items in an iterable, but for whatever reason, you can't
         or don't want to use a for loop

Solution: To manually consume an iterable, use the next() function and write you code
          to catch the StopIteration exception.

4.2 Delegating Iteration

Problem: You have built a custom container object that internally holds a list, tuple or
         some other iterable. You would like to make iteration work with your new container

Solution: Typically, all you need to do is define an __iter__() method that delegates iteration
          to the internally held container.

4.3. Creating New Iteration Pattern with Generators

Problem: You want to implement a custom iteration pattern that's different than the usual

Solution: If you want to implement a new kind of iteration pattern, define it using a generator
          function. Here's a generator that produces a range of floating-point numbers.

4.4. Implementing the Iterator Protocol

Problem: You are building custom objects on which you would like to support iteration, but

4.6 Defining Generator Functions with Extra State

Problem: You would like to define a generator function, but it involves extra state that

          can easily implement it as a class, putting the generator function code in the
