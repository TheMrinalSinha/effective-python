2.1 - splitting strings on any of multiple delimiters

Problem: you need to split a string into fields, but the delimiters (and spacing
around them) aren't consists throughout the string.

from re import split as re_split

line = 'asdf fjdk; afed, fjek,asdf,   foo'

# The re.split() function is useful because you can specify multiple patterns for the
# separator. For example, as shown in the solution, the separator is either a comma (,),
# semicolon (;), or whitespace followed by any amount of extra whitespace. Whenever
# that pattern is found, the entire match becomes the delimiter between whatever fields
# lie on either side of the match. The result is a list of fields, just as with str.split() .

fields = re_split(r'(;|,|\s)\s*', line)
print(f"Fields: {fields}")

# If you donâ€™t want the separator characters in the result, but still need to use parentheses
# to group parts of the regular expression pattern, make sure you use a noncapture group,
# specified as (?:...) .

2.3. Matching strings using shell wildcard patterns

Problem: you want to match text using the same wildcard patterns as are commonly used when

Solution: the fnmatch module provides two functions - fnmatch() and fnmatchcase() - that can
          be used to perform such matching. The usage in simple
