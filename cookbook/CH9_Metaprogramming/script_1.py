"""
One of the most important mantras of software development is "Don't repeat yourself".
That is, any time you are facing problem with creating highly repetitive code, it often
pays to look for a more elegant solution. In Python, such problems are often solved under
the category of "metaprogramming"

In a nutshell, metagrogramming is about creating functions and classes whose main goal is
to manipulate code (eg. modifying, generating or wrapping existing code).

Main features include:
- decorators
- class decorators
- metaclasses
and other useful topics -- including signature objects, execution of code with exec() and
inspecting the internals of functions and classes.
