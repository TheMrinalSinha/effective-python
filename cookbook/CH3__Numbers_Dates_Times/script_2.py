3.5. Packing and Unpacking large integers from bytes

Problem: You have a byte string you need to unpack it into an integer value, Alternatively,
         You need to convert large integer back into a byte string.

Solution: Suppose your program needs to work with a 16-element byte string that holds a
          128 bit integer value.

# Converting large integer values to and from byte strings is not a common operation.
# However, it sometimes arises in certain application domains, such as cryptography or
# networking. For instance, IPv6 network addresses are represented as 128-bit integers.
# If you are writing code that needs to pull such values out of a data record, you might
# face this problem.

3.7. Working with Infinity and NaNs

Problems: You need to create or test for the floating-point values of infinity, negative infinity
          or NaN (not a number).

# Python has no special syntax to represent these special floating-point values, but they
# can be created using float().
